    <h1>Trend of Electric Vehicles in Washington State</h1>

    <p>
        I plan to analyze a dataset containing information on electric vehicles in Washington State.
        Utilizing both the data analysis techniques I have learned and those I will acquire throughout the
        course, my project aims to explore the following key questions:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>What has been the growth rate of electric vehicle adoption over time?</li>
        <li>Which companies are gaining more customers, and which are falling behind in the competition?</li>
        <li>Which manufacturers frequently introduce new models?</li>
        <li>How has the electric range of vehicles improved over the years?</li>
        <li>Which cities in Washington State show the highest interest in transitioning to electric vehicles based on the data?</li>
        <li>What future market trends can be predicted based on current findings?</li>
    </ol>
