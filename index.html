    <h1>Trend of electric vehicles in Washington State</h1>
    <p>I plan to analyze a dataset containing information on electric vehicles in Washington State.
Utilizing both the data analysis techniques I have learned and those I will acquire throughout the
course, my project aims to explore the following key questions:
1. What has been the growth rate of electric vehicle adoption over time?
2. Which companies are gaining more customers, and which are falling behind in the
competition?
3. Which manufacturers frequently introduce new models?
4. How has the electric range of vehicles improved over the years?
5. Which cities in Washington State show the highest interest in transitioning to electric
vehicles based on the data?
6. What future market trends can be predicted based on current findings?
